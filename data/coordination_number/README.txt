Coordination number distribution for each bGEM type with different molecules.

Naming of files is bGEM type followed by  molecule type (DNA molecule, ribosome, positive crowder, or negative crowder).

The 0q bGEM is a bGEM with zero charge which is used to normalize the values presented in Figure 3 of the manuscript.

Each row is a different timestep, and each column is the probability of having that many contacts.

For instance, in contact_dist.n7q_DNA_all.txt, the the third column in the first row has the percentage of -7e bGEMs with 2 DNA neighbors at the first timestep (the first column is zero contacts).

All calculations were made using the post-processing code calc_contact.py.
