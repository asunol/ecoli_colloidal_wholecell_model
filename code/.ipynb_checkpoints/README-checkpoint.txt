Provided here is the code to run the event-based long-time simulations, an example packmol script for the initialization of the LAMMPS simulations, and postprocessing code that analyzes trajectories produced by the colloidal whole-cell model.  Additional code requests, such as for custom LAMMPS source code files and scripts that were used in the colloidal whole-cell model, should be submitted to rzia@missouri.edu.
